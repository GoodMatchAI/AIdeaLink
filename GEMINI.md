# AIdeaLink Project Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the AIdeaLink project, its structure, and instructions for development and execution.

## Project Purpose

AIdeaLink is an AI-driven tool designed to match startup founders with early-stage investors. It was developed for the GoodFin x AWS AI Hack Day Challenge. The project leverages agentic AI to connect innovative ideas with capital, using synthetic profiles and providing transparent reasoning for its matching decisions.

## Technologies and Architecture

*   **Core Language:** Python 3.9+
*   **Key Libraries:**
    *   `crewai`: For orchestrating AI agents.
    *   `weaviate-client`: For interacting with the Weaviate vector database.
    *   `comet_ml`: For experiment tracking and observability.
    *   `requests`: For making HTTP requests.
    *   `faker`: For generating synthetic data.
    *   `python-dotenv`: For managing environment variables.
    *   `friendli`: For interacting with the FriendliAI API.
*   **Database:** Weaviate (vector database), expected to be run via Docker.
*   **Authentication:** API keys for services like FriendliAI and Weaviate are managed via a `.env` file.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
.
├── .env
├── .gitignore
├── main.py
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
├── scripts/
│   ├── generate_profiles.py
│   ├── load_data.py
│   └── profiles.json
└── src/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── agents.py
    ├── crew.py
    └── tools.py
```

*   **`main.py`**: The main entry point for the application (currently missing).
*   **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the Python dependencies (currently missing).
*   **`scripts/`**: Contains scripts for data generation and loading.
    *   **`generate_profiles.py`**: Generates synthetic founder and investor profiles and saves them to `profiles.json`.
*   **`src/`**: Contains the core application logic (currently missing).
*   **`.env`**: Stores API keys and other secrets (needs to be created).

## Building and Running the Project

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Python 3.9+
    *   Docker

2.  **Installation:**
    *   Clone the repository.
    *   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
        ```
        crewai
        weaviate-client
        comet_ml
        requests
        faker
        python-dotenv
        friendli
        ```
    *   Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3.  **Setup:**
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys:
        ```
        FRIENDLI_TOKEN=your_key
        WEAVIATE_URL=http://localhost:8080
        ```
    *   Start Weaviate using Docker Compose: `docker compose up -d`
    *   Generate the synthetic data: `python scripts/generate_profiles.py`

4.  **Running the Application:**
    *   The `main.py` file is missing, so the application cannot be run at the moment. A `main.py` file needs to be created with the core application logic.

## Development Conventions

*   **Code Style:** The existing code in `generate_profiles.py` follows standard Python conventions.
*   **Dependencies:** All Python dependencies should be listed in `requirements.txt`.
*   **Data:** The application uses synthetic data from `profiles.json`. This file can be regenerated by running `scripts/generate_profiles.py`.
*   **Configuration:** API keys and other configuration should be stored in a `.env` file.
